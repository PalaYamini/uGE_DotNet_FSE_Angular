<h1>My Introduction</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Pala Yamini Supriya. I’m from Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh, 
    and I recently completed my B.Tech in Internet of Things from Gudlavalleru Engineering College with a CGPA of 8.53. 
    I have worked on projects like a Python-based web scraper and a BMI calculator, which helped me strengthen my programming and problem-solving skills. 
    I also completed AWS Cloud Practitioner certification through a government training program, 
    where I built and deployed a resource monitoring application using Python, Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes on AWS. 
    I am currently improving my skills in Python, cloud, and DevOps tools, and I’m looking for an opportunity to start my career, 
    learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to real-world projects.</p>
